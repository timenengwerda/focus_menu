# focus_menu
When tabbing through a menu the submenu's tend to be ignored. This fixes it with some Javascript and a custom .focus class.

Usage: <code>$('ul.menu').dropdownFocusMenu();</code> in your <code>$(document).ready();</code>

Make sure to create a li.focus object in your CSS for this to visually work!

Usually it's the same as a li:hover. So that's rather easy I guess.
